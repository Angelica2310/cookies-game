## ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to build a game with basic concept, easy for user to play. I retrived data from API so the game get up-to-date information. My function also neat and tidy. User has all abilities to play, reset the game, turn on/off background sound, adjust the sound volumn and read the instruction on 'how to play'. The game also being stored at the local storage so user can leave and play later. The game also have different sounds when click the 'cookie', when buying upgrade or when they do not have enough cookie, create a fun experience for user. The screen also being oriented so this game can be played in any devices.
## ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I am quite happy with this week project ðŸ˜Š
## ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I think the API part is the most difficult stuff, I have done many research to sort it.
